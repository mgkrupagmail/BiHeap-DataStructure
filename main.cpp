// Description : For the definition of a BiHeap, see the comments at the top
//  of biheapify.h.
// This file contains calls to functions that time and test the various
//  BiHeapify functions; these are:
// (1) MeasureBiHeapifyInwardsPivotProperties(), which measures how good
//      of a pivot value the BiHeapifyInwards() algorithm produces.
//     The most important quantities that are outputted by this function
//      are the smallest value of min(# elements <= pivot, # elements >= pivot),
//      that was encountered and the average of value of
//      min(# elements <= pivot, # elements >= pivot).
// (2) MeasureBiHeapifySuccessRate(), which verifies that our implementation
//      of the BiHeapify algorithm works correctly.
// (3) BiHeapSiftTestCorrectness(), which verifies that our implementation
//      of the BiHeapSift() algorithm works correctly.
// (4) TimeBiHeapifies(), which times the various BiHeapify functions, and
